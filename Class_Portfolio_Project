'''Create an automobile class that will be used by a dealership as a vehicle inventory program.
The following attributes should be present in your automobile class:
private string make
private string model
private string color

Your program should have appropriate methods such as:

At the end of your program, it should allow the user to output all vehicle inventory to a text file.
